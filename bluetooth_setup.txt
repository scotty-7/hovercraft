The following changes were made so that the bluetooth serivce automatically connects to the Pro Controller

hold the pair button on the pro controller until the leds flash

in terminal:
$ bluetoothctl
[blueooth]# $agent on
[blueooth]# $default-agent
[blueooth]# $scan on
[blueooth]# $pair <BT MAC Address of Pro Controller>
[blueooth]# $trust <BT MAC Address of Pro Controller>
[blueooth]# $scan off
[blueooth]# $quit

The pro controller should now connect automatically, and should resume the link if the connection is broken for some reason.

----------------------

/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service was edited to change the line:

*ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd

To

*ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd -C
*ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/sdptool add SP

----------------------

A system daemon was written to automatically wait for the incoming bluetooth connection, and connect it to the serial port rfcomm0.

$sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rfcomm.service

*[Unit]
*Description=RFCOMM service
*After=bluetooth.service
*Requires=bluetooth.service
 
*[Service]
*ExecStart=/usr/bin/rfcomm watch hci0
 
*[Install]
*WantedBy=multi-user.target

----------------------

Next enable the daemon by running
$sudo systemctl enable rfcomm

The daemon will now run on startup, but to run it immediately, run:
$sudo systemctl start rfcomm
