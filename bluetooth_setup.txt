The following changes were made so that the bluetooth serivce automatically connects to the Pro Controller

hold the pair button on the pro controller until the leds flash

in terminal:
$ bluetoothctl
[blueooth]# $agent on
[blueooth]# $default-agent
[blueooth]# $scan on
[blueooth]# $pair <BT MAC Address of Pro Controller>
[blueooth]# $trust <BT MAC Address of Pro Controller>
[blueooth]# $scan off
[blueooth]# $quit

The pro controller should now connect automatically, and should resume the link if the connection is broken for some reason.
